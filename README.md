## **Example Usage**

### **Input**:
```
Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program):
1001b2
Enter a string as number#2 (or "quit" to end the program):
11b3
Enter a base for output: (a number [2,16]):
10
```
### **Output**:
```
1001b2 + 11b3 = 13
1001b2 * 11b3 = 36
Max number over [1001b2, 11b3, 13, 36] is: 36
```
